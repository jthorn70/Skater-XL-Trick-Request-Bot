# Skater-XL-Trick-Request-Bot
TTS trick request bot for twitch. 

**YOU MUST PUT YOUR OATH TOKEN IN THE OPTIONS.JS FILE FOR THIS TO WORK**

I would recommend opening this entire repo in VS Code or your preffered editor. I use VS Code beacuse you can run the terminal in the same window and edit the options.js file.

# How to Install
- install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Clone the repository to preferred destination
- Retrieve your OATH token from twitch [here](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/)

- Run the auto.py python script to run the bot or alternatively, In the command line, navigate to the destination of the cloned repository
